# Deep Learning–Powered Full Face Detection & Multi-Attribute Facial Analytics

A real-time AI system for face detection combined with age, gender, emotion, and drowsiness analysis.

---

## Overview

This project is an integrated facial analytics system built using deep learning and computer vision.  
It detects faces from live video input and performs multiple attribute predictions with high accuracy and low latency.  
A real-time dashboard provides clean visualization of all predictions and system alerts.
