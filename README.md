🧠 Deep Learning–Powered Full Face Detection & Multi-Attribute Facial Analytics

AI system for real-time face detection, age & gender prediction, emotion recognition, and drowsiness detection, enhanced with a live dashboard.

⭐ Overview

This project is a real-time intelligent facial analytics system built using deep learning and computer vision.
It detects a person’s face and instantly predicts:
✔ Age
✔ Gender
✔ Emotion
✔ Drowsiness (eye-closure monitoring)

A fully interactive dashboard displays live analytics, visualizations, and alert notifications.

🚀 Key Features

🔍 High-accuracy face detection using deep learning

🎭 Emotion recognition (happy, sad, angry, surprise, fear, disgust, neutral)

👁️ Drowsiness detection using eye-aspect ratio (EAR) + alerts

👨‍🦱 Age & gender prediction via CNN models

📊 Real-time dashboard built with Flask/Streamlit

⚡ Optimized for fast inference (20–30 FPS)

🧩 Modular architecture — each feature can run independently

📹 Works with webcam or external video feed
